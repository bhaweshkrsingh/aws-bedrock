    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to make use of Langgraph, Langchain, Amazon Bedrock Run-time Agents, and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases as a RAG source to retrieve relevant documents. It uses Amazon OpenSearch serverless as vectorDB and S3 bucket as the storage of all the source/refrence files. It uses master agent controlled, multi-agents for the tasks like: 1. relevancy check of each document retrieved from AWS KB, 2. LLM's hallucination check, 3. relevancy check of the LLM's generated answer w.r.t question, 4. make call to live internet search(currently Dummy), if it doesn't find any relevant document in the Amazon Bedrock KB."
